				  I am having an issue with bootstrap navbar in terms of responsiveness. 
				  I used data-spy="affix" on my navbar to make sure it stays fixed at the top while scrolling down and it works perfectly. 
				  The problem however is when I resize the window to mobile dimension.
				  When I resize to mobile dimension the right part of my navbar will appear out of bounds. 
				  Meaning I can't see the content because my navbar is too wide for the screen. 
				  However, when I scroll down and the affix effect takes over, my navbar scales to mobile screen and the content that went out of
				  screen will align perfectly for the mobile screen and the entire navbar will be responsive.</p>
